The SpotOn app allows a user to choose an activity. The app will assist in rapidly creating a new Spotify playlist around the search query that relates to that activity.

A user can select an activity and/or genre. A list of songs will populate the center of the app. <br/>
A user can manually edit the list by deleting or transfering a song to the final list on the right side of the app. <br/>
A user can save queries to use for future use by clicking save at the top of the middle section<br/>
A user can recall a previously saved query by choosing from the dropdown in the middle section<br/>
A user can transfer a random selection of up to 50 songs over to the final list on the right hand of the app.<br/>
A user can click on any song to have it played on the current device that Spotify has activated (desktop app, phone app, google home, etc.)<br/>
A user can save the final playlist to their account
